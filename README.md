Spark-TTS for Framecraft
-------

This is a fork of `SparkAudio/Spark-TTS`. The fork achieves the following:
- removes the cli and web ui interface from the original repo, as well as any examples
- converts the repo into an installable python package managed with `uv`
- enhances the core Spark-TTS Bicodec Tokenizer to support blending of cloned voices.
